- Finish understanding ORBSLAM and be able to log information from it (ORB features, descriptors, keyframes and their locations, information matrix, solver residuals (pre and post solve), ...)
- More, better, different data (real world datasets (camera, stereo & ground truth))
- Look into also simulator for new data
- Re-implement the Ali paper
- Make a heuristic method
	- Tools for data analysis 
- Continue deep learning experiments (larger networks, more data (images and metadata))
